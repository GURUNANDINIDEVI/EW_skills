Compute the parity (reduction XOR) of an 8-bit input and also produce the bit-reversed version of that input—by calling the pre-defined functions in the template.

Requirements

Module: parity_and_reverse

Input: a[7:0]

Outputs: parity, rev[7:0]

Use the two pre-defined functions parity8() and reverse8() exactly as provided.
