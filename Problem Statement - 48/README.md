Return the larger of two 8-bit unsigned inputs using a function.

Behavior

max = a if a > b

max = b otherwise

Requirements

Module: max2_func

Inputs: a[7:0], b[7:0]

Outputs: max[7:0]

Additional Notes:

A function max2(x,y) is provided — write the single comparison line inside it.

Call max2(a,b) to drive max.

Pure combinational RTL (no delays, no latches).
