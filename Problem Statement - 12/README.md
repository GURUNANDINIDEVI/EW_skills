Design a combinational module bitwise_ops_demo that demonstrates the use of vector bitwise operators.

Requirements
Module name: bitwise_ops_demo
Inputs:
A[3:0] (4-bit)
B[3:0] (4-bit)
Outputs:

AND_OUT[3:0] = bitwise AND of A and B

OR_OUT[3:0] = bitwise OR of A and B

XOR_OUT[3:0] = bitwise XOR of A and B

XNOR_OUT[3:0] = bitwise XNOR of A and B
